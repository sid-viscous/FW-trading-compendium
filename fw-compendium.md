## General trading philosophies

Every market is a ponzi scheme, it is just a matter of perspective and timeframe. You need buyers to come in after you to make profit (if you are trading on spot markets). 

No strategy is 100% accurate, trades should be made on expected probabilities of movements, with capital being managed appropriately for the risk level.


### Wojak strategy

![Frustrated wojak](images/wojak.png)

* Wojak is always in a bad mood when trading
* He is constantly frustrated that most of his trades go against him
* He chases green candles, hoping they will continue upward
* He doesn't follow his own trading strategies or risk management strategies
* He forgets to sell when he is in profit, thinking he can make more profit
* When Wojak is in the red on a trade, his recovery strategy is hope, he ends up panic selling at a huge loss, just before the market recovers.
